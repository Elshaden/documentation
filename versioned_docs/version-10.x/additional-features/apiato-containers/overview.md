Apiato ships with a few pre-defined and pre-configured containers. These containers are created by Apiato team and are guaranteed to work with a fresh Apiato installation.
Some of these containers (e.g. [Documentation](documentation) & [Debugger](debugger)) are installed by default with a fresh Apiato project.
