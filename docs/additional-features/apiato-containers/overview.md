title: Overview

Apiato ships with a few pre-defined and pre-configured containers. However, other developers may provide additional
features in form of a respective container using [Container Installer](../../getting-started/container-installer).
Although these containers may work perfectly out of the box, they only serve as some kind of "blueprint" in order 
to get you kickstart your own application. These containers may not contain "production-ready code". Please revise them carefully.

### Apiato Containers
These containers are created by Apiato team and are guaranteed to work with a fresh Apiato installation.
Some of these containers (e.g. [Documentation](documentation) & [Debugger](debugger)) are installed by default with a fresh Apiato project.

### Community Containers
These containers are developed by Apiato community and provided as is.
